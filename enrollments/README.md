```bash
python manage.py test enrollments
```

### Test Coverage
- Model creation and constraints
- Enrollment services (completion, progress)
- API endpoints (enrollment, wishlist, progress)
- Auto-completion logic
- Navigation (next lesson, resume)

## Usage Examples

### Enrolling in a Course
```python
from enrollments.models import Enrollment
from courses.models import Course
from accounts.models import User

user = User.objects.get(email='student@example.com')
course = Course.objects.get(id=1)

enrollment = Enrollment.objects.create(user=user, course=course)
```

### Tracking Lesson Progress
```python
from enrollments.services import mark_lesson_completed

lesson = Lesson.objects.get(id=1)
mark_lesson_completed(enrollment, lesson)
```

### Adding to Wishlist
```python
from enrollments.models import Wishlist

wishlist = Wishlist.objects.create(user=user, course=course)
```

## Security

- All endpoints require authentication
- Users can only access their own enrollments and progress
- Instructors can only access analytics for their own courses
- Proper permission checks on all API endpoints

## Performance Optimization

- Select_related used for foreign keys
- Prefetch_related for reverse relationships
- Indexed fields for common queries
- Efficient aggregation queries for statistics

## Future Enhancements

- Learning streaks and achievements
- Personalized learning recommendations
- Social features (study groups, forums)
- Offline progress syncing
- Certificate generation integration
- Email notifications for completions
- Progress reminders
